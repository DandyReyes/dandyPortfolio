            Hola, my name is <i>Dandy</i>. I am a
            <b> Latino Software Engineer</b> and <b>UI/UX Designer</b>. I love
            coding, creating and helping people get to the next level in their
            career path as developers. I advocate for foster youth and love to
            mentor young developers.

            <br />
            Some of my crazy hobbies are building robots from the ground up,
            biking, knitting, and throwing get togethers. Iâ€™m a people person!
