# Welcome to my Portfolio

The reason I built this site is so I could have more control over what my site does and if I want to optimize, then I could do that. I love creative freedom and my site shows that part of myself.

> Let's get started

You will need several tools for this (the list will get bigger as I add to the site):

- node
- npm
- git

node & npm installation:

- this is fairly straight forward, just follow this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the latest version of node

npm **in** project installation:

- Open Linux/Unix based terminal
- While on your current project folder, type in `npm init -y`
- Then run `npm install`

git installation:

- Open Linux/Unix based terminal
- While on your current project folder, type in `git --version` and if none exists, it'll prompt you to download!
- Here is the [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you are having trouble
